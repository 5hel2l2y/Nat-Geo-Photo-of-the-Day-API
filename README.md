## Roadmap of Getting National Geographic Photo of the Day
I started this project to create an API to retrieve the Photo of the Day by National Geographic as a dynamic background image for my static bio page.  Here's my roadmap to get to the one today,

* 2015 - Discovered the idea, [photo of the day on National Geographic's website](http://photography.nationalgeographic.com/photography/photo-of-the-day/)
  * Found [Sterling Whitley's API](https://github.com/sterlingw/Nat-Geo-Photo-of-the-Day-API) and forked my own
* 2016 - National Geographic updated web framework, API broked
  * Created a direct retrieve for image based on the updated website
* 2019 - Made my own GitHub Page and wanted the dynamic background image back again
  * Found [crisboarna's national-geographic-api](https://github.com/crisboarna/national-geographic-api) and made it work

API available at [Heroku](https://natgeo.herokuapp.com/api/dailyphoto)
